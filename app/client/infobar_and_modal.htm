  <h1>Sharibble!</h1>

  <p><em>Sharibble</em> is an anonymous image & video sharing chat platform.</p>

  <p>All users are anonymous except for the colorful icon that represents them. You can re-roll for a new random icon by refreshing the page or clicking the icon at the top of the chat.</p>



  <h1>Image and Video Support</h1>

  <p><strong>Images:</strong> Please only link to image hosting websites. We support .png, .jpg, .jpeg, and .gif formats.</p>
  <p><strong>Image Albums</strong> We are currently working on adding support for Imgur Albums</p>
  <p><strong>Videos:</strong> We are currently working on adding YouTube and Vimeo embedding support.</p>



  <h1>Privacy</h1>

  <p>Only the last <strong>50 lines</strong> of the chat are stored in the database. This means that all older comments are permanently deleted. Sharibble cares about your privacy and anonymity. We do not keep a log of IP addresses, or of links posted here. <strong>Once it's gone, it's gone</strong>. If you want to preserve a moment in the chat, your best bet is with a screenshot.</p>

  <p>All image icons are from TheNounProject and are public domain. If there is an icon you'd like added to the chat, let us know and we might create it and release it in to the public domain.</p>



  <h1>Objectionable Content</h1>

  <p>
    <q>What do I do if someone posts somthing offensive?</q>
    Best thing to do is to ignore it and post a different link to replace it. Since all content here is temporary and we don't store anything other than the last 50 comments, we have no way of verifying reports. If someone links to content that is illegal, contact the administrators of the server the content is hosted on and alert them of the content.
  </p>



  <h1>Private chats</h1>

  <p>Private chats are a feature we are working on that would all you to create your own unique sharibble.net URL to invite friends to!</p>
