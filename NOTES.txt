#Full Frontal Paging To Do list

* Correct Anchor tags
* all image urls in chat are links
* detect if user sends 10 messages in under 15 seconds and disable their chat for 60 sec
* re-do markup to use JS for image resize and chatlog width/drag
* Make an info bar and about page to explain privacy
* Change image urls to be <a href="http://33.media.tumblr.com/1eb50966067d35cfffa61aa6a162e1e8/tumblr_navr8bZnjK1tixdy7o1_1280.jpg">Tumblr Image</a> or <a href="http://i.imgur.com/GtxhJh0.gif">Imgur Image</a> or <a href="https://anydomain.com/file.jpg">Anydomain Image</a>. And eventually we'll want to detect specifically youtube and vimeo links and say YouTube Video or Vimeo Video.

#Long Term Goals

* imgur api for albums
* embed and auto play youtube/vimeo
* detect imgur links that don't end in filetype and pull the image from the page
*
